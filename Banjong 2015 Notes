Banjong, Delphine 2015 Notes

Banjong, Delphine N. 2015. International Students' Enhanced Academic Performance: Effects of Campus Resources. Journal of International Students 5:1, 132-142

*International students often rely on campus resources to handle their particular set of challenges, with surmounting challenges essential to academic success
*Mitigating the language barrier is a functional prerequisite for academic achievement in most cases, and resources like the writing center are especially important
*These must be accompanied by social support resources to help ensure students are aware of available support
*Homesickness/loneliness and financial difficultues are additional stressors reported by international students

- Good, succinct coverage of major threads in the more psychology-focused literature, with a tie-in to the more geographic side of things as well. Kind of an inside-campus companion to 
Kusek (2015), which is more external-focused, I think
