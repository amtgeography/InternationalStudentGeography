Poyrazli and Grahame 20XX Notes 8/2017

Poyrazli, Senel & Grahame, Kamini Maraj. (20XX?) Barriers to Adjustment: Needs of International Students within a Semi-Urban Campus Community. Journal of Instructional Psychology 34:1, 28-45

* Barriers to international student success come in several primary forms: academics, health, housing, transportation, and discrimination
* Literature often emphasizes intrinsic personality traits as essential to acclimatization process, misses role of the setting/environment
* Initial acclimatization/acculturation difficulties common, can be exacerbated or mitigated by resources in the environment
* Study on suburban campus in mid-US indicates significant variation in experiences/challenges
* Region of origin tends to impact individual students' specific needs, but access to appropriate resources essential for academic and personal success

 - Good coverage of literature and key issues, transcends psychological emphasis common in similar studies to focus on physical environment. Does a good job of laying out both problems and solutions, and advocates a holistic view of the challenges. Good bridge between Psychology discipline and Human Geography?
