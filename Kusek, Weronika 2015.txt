Kusek, Weronika 2015 Notes

Kusek, Weronika A. 2015. Evaluating the Struggles with International Students and Local Community Participation. Journal of International Students 5:2, 121-131

*The relationship between international students and the hosting community adjacent to their university is under-examined in the literature
*International students often become culturally/socially isolated if unable to access the community, whether through lack of activities or lack of proximity
*Many form ad-hoc groupings, often with students from similar origins, in order to mitigate isolation, and this is often done outside the bounds of the university
*Particularly for students from backgrounds where regular interaction with the community is the norm, acculturation can be difficult despite widespread desire to explore local culture
*Key on-campus resources at suburban Ohio campus include the Student center, library, computer labs, and recreation center, as well as international student groups

 - Takes a cultural-geography approach not typical in literature, combined with questionnaire and survey materials. One of the pieces that emphasizes the importance fo transportation interface between campus and community where there is a lot of physical separation. Also focuses on the perception of the international students themselves, not just their responses on standard survey instruments.
